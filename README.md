# Create Lab [![Build](https://github.com/Blukzen/CreateLab/actions/workflows/gradle-publish.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)](https://github.com/Blukzen/CreateLab/actions/workflows/gradle-publish.yml)

## Overview

Create lab is a dimension mod initially designed to be paired with the Create mod. This mod adds a new "laboratory" dimension that is a test world for you to try out builds contraptions etc in creative mode without having to switch to another world. The laboratory dimension holds its own player inventory allowing you to switch between the lab and your survival world without one impacting the other.

## Features

- The laboratory, a creative mode dimension with separate player inventories. Access using `/lab tp`
