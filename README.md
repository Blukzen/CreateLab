## Overview

Create lab is a dimension mod initially designed to be paired with the Create mod. This mod adds a new "laboratory" dimension that is a test world for you to try out builds contraptions etc in creative mode without having to switch to another save game. The laboratory dimension holds its own player inventory allowing you to switch between the lab and your survival world without one impacting the other.

## Features

- The laboratory, a creative mode, flat gen dimension with no mob spawns.
- Seperate inventories between survival dimensions and the laboratory.
- Dimension access via survival crafted portal or using `/lab tp` if OP.
- Curios integration, curios inventory slots will also be kept separate from survival dimensions.

## How to use
1. Craft the laboratory portal catalyst using 4 quartz and a diamond.
2. Build a portal frame using smooth quartz, the portal frame rules are the same as vanilla nether portals.
3. Right click on the portal frame using the laboratory catalyst
